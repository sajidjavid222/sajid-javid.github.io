## Overview

- **Urban Congestion Analysis:** Investigation of urban traffic congestion issues and inefficiencies in traditional traffic management systems.  
- **Real-Time Detection with YOLOv8s:** Utilization of YOLOv8s deep learning models for real-time detection of cars, two-wheelers, autos, buses, and trucks.  
- **Performance Evaluation:** Achieves 80% precision for cars and a mean average precision (mAP@0.5) of 85.8%, highlighting areas for improvement in other vehicle classes through data augmentation techniques.  
- **Adaptive Traffic Control Integration:** Discussion on integrating the vehicle detection system with adaptive traffic light control to enhance traffic flow and urban safety.
