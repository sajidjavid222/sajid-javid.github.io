## Overview

This paper addresses the problem of indoor radio environment mapping (REM), with applications across wireless networks:

- **Hybrid Architecture**: Introduces Trans-REM, which combines a CNN for local spatial feature extraction with a transformer for capturing global context, leveraging the strengths of both models.
- **Auxiliary Inputs**: Develops two new input modalities—a line-of-sight (LoS) image and an antenna radiation pattern image—to guide the network in understanding complex indoor propagation characteristics.
- **Performance Gains**: Demonstrates through extensive numerical evaluations that Trans-REM outperforms state-of-the-art REM methods by at least 15 % in mean squared error on a comprehensive indoor dataset.
