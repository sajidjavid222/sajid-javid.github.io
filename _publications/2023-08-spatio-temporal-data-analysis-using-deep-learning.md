## Overview

In this paper we explore:

- **Spatial–Temporal Modeling:** Analytics of the ability of deep learning to learn complex relationships between the spatial and temporal dimensions of the data.
- **Method Evaluation:** Evaluation of various deep learning methods applied to tasks in the field of spatio‐temporal analytics, such as transportation, social media event detection, environmental monitoring, human mobility prediction, action recognition, and related domains.
