# Internships

### Google Research ExploreCSR Intern – IIT Roorkee  
**Jan 2024 — Jun 2024**  
– Developed an end-to-end intelligent traffic management system utilizing computer vision, machine learning, and optimization algorithms to enhance vehicular flow.  
– Designed and built a robust vehicle detection and counting module capable of differentiating and tallying cars, trucks, and motorcycles in real-time video feeds.  
– Leveraged detection data to devise an adaptive traffic signal timing algorithm using density-based optimizations, reducing junction delays and overall congestion.

### Intern Railway Scientist – L2MRail (IISc Bangalore startup)  
**Jul 2022 — Oct 2022**  
– Contributed to the development of the Wheel Impact Load Detector (F-WILD) system in collaboration with RDSO and Indian Railways, capturing and processing real-time train wheel signature data from instrumented track sections.  
– Applied YOLO-based object detection to analyze and interpret wheel signatures for anomaly detection.  
– Processed platform-camera imagery to extract critical train health metrics and reported urgent wheel-damage alerts to railway authorities.

### Machine Learning & Data Science Intern – Internship Studio  
**Mar 2022 — Apr 2022**  
– Implemented a suite of regression and classification algorithms to predict YouTube ad view counts from platform metrics.  
– Built and evaluated multiple ML models—including linear regression, decision trees, and an artificial neural network—achieving robust predictive performance on real‐world data.
