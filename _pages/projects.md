## 2. üõçÔ∏è Enhancing Product Categorization with Transformer-Based Attribute Prediction

*Part of IndoML 2024 @ BITS Pilani Goa Campus ‚Äì Ranked 9th out of 400+ teams* [(link)](#)

* Utilized transformer models (BERT, LLaMa-2-7B, GPT-J) for multi-task classification and generative tasks.
* Integrated FAISS-based data augmentation; best performance with GPT-J (6B parameters).
* Handled overfitting with hyperparameter tuning and adaptive learning.
* Applied to real-world multi-label e-commerce classification, emphasizing scalability.
