# 👋 Welcome to My Portfolio


Welcome! I'm **Sajid Javid**, a second-year **Ph.D. student** in the **Department of Computer Science and Engineering** at **IIIT Delhi**. I’m passionate about building intelligent system models that tackle real-world challenges using the power of machine learning and AI with a primary focus on wireless communications and networks. I am currently working as part of the **i-CPS (Intelligent Communication, Processing, and Sensing) Lab** under **Prof. Shamik Sarkar\[[link]\](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10867216)**, where we focus on developing algorithms and implementations for intelligent wireless communication and sensing systems.

Throughout my education and research experiences, I have explored diverse areas within computer science, collaborating on projects that span artificial intelligence, computer vision, natural language processing, and wireless communication. These experiences have shaped my approach to problem-solving and fueled my passion for learning and experimentation.

My background also includes hands-on involvement in teaching, leadership roles in technical clubs, and participation in national and international events. I value collaboration, critical thinking, and the process of turning ideas into meaningful solutions.


This website serves as a glimpse into my professional world—a space to share my research interests, academic progress, and selected projects.
