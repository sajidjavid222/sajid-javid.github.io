# 👋 Welcome to My Portfolio

Welcome! I'm **Sajid Javid**, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at **IIIT Delhi**. I’m passionate about building intelligent system models that tackle real-world challenges using the power of machine learning and AI with primary focus on wireless communications and networks.

Throughout my education and research experiences, I have explored diverse areas within computer science, collaborating on projects that span artificial intelligence, computer vision, natural language processing, and wireless communication. These experiences have shaped my approach to problem-solving and fueled my passion for learning and experimentation.

My background also includes hands-on involvement in teaching, leadership roles in technical clubs, and participation in national and international events. I value collaboration, critical thinking, and the process of turning ideas into meaningful solutions.


This website serves as a glimpse into my professional world—a space to share my research interests, academic progress, and selected projects.
